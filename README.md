# Shor's-Algorithm
Shor’s algorithm routine that will allow the factoring of large and complex numbers. Although there are a few restrictions to the algorithm: that numbers cannot be prime, shouldn’t be an even number and not in exponent notation. 

## The Algorithm
1. The first step in the algorithm is to take a number that you want to factor and designate that as N.  In the source code, this is represented by user input to allow the user to choose which number they want input that can be factored. The source code doesn't contain checks for the general rules of thumb for the algorithm, but it is likely that if a number is inserted that won't work it will just return to user input.
2. The next step is to then declare a second number K which is a number between 1 and N. In the source code represents this through random number generation given a range between 1 and the number input by the user. Random Number Generation is used to increase execution speed, otherwise the user would have to have another input to manage.
3. The next step is to then find the GCD(N,K) – If GCD is not equal to one then the GCD is a factor of N else if it is one you move on. If one, then you will need to find the smallest positive integer, r, such that f(x) = (k^x)mod N then f(a) = (a+r). 
4. Now you will need to define another variable q, now you will need to find (qxk)mod N. If the remainder is not one, then se the value of q to the value of the remainder that was calculated and repeat this step until the remainder is one; keeping track of the iterations of the recursion. The number of transformations that you calculated 1…N will be the r use in the equation. If r is an odd number go back to the second step, choosing a random number K.
5. Otherwise, define p = remainder in (r/2)th transformation – If p + 1 = N then go back to step two otherwise move on to the final step of the algorithm.
6.  Now you will be able to generate the factors of N by sampling doing f1 = GCD(p+1, N) and f2 = GCD(p-1, N).

## Why Python?
For the purposes of completing this assignment I chose to utilize Python, because it was familiar to me, but is also a language that is frequently used in Quantum Computing. Due to Travel and an impending Hurricane I didn't want to attempt to learn a language that was unfamliar to me at the moment. Before starting the programming I did look into Shor's Algorithm for Paper 1, as it was an extension of the Fourier Transformation, and actually includes the Fourier Transformation as one of its steps in the algorithm. In Paper 1 I do go into detail a little more about the background but I lay the groundwork for the algorithm that I implemented. Before deciding to utilize Python I did some research into Silq as it was touted as a language that was easy to use and took the more difficult aspects of other quantum programming languages, and fixed them, by automating them essentially. When looking into the language, it was found that the syntax, to me at least was a little confusing because there are a lot of nuiances that are unique to the language that don't exist in other languages. For that reason I chose to use Pythong, and because of that it is also a little easier to follow along with the algorithm as it implements and executes code.
